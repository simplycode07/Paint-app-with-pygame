# Paint App made with pygame (I haven't named it yet)

## Worst painting app ever!!
It's a really basic and one of the worst painting app ever created

## Features
To be honest nothing much
- You can Create really bad images with it
- You can Save images you have created
- Added tool to draw rectangles and circles
- but it comes with a color palette with 7 colors and a random color which is generated when program starts

## How To Use
- Run the program by ```python main.py```
- There are different buttons for different colors in the first row
- In the second row there are two tools, for drawing circle and rectangle(for now)

- To use any drawing tool: first select preferred color, then click on diagonally opposite vertices of the rectangle or diametrically opposite ends of circle
